# Bootstrap-Portfolio
A basic portfolio made using the Bootstrap library.

This is a basic web portfolio made using the Bootstrap library. It's patterned after an earlier basic web portfolio *found here*: (https://github.com/origamiunicorn/Basic-Portfolio). Instead of writing and referring to css stylesheets within the website, only the Bootstrap stylesheet was used, with the HTML elements of this web portfolio's pages given individual overrides in classes and styles to better mimic the original web portfolio. This is all part of a homework assignment for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020).
